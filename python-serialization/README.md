  Tasks related to reading, writing, appending files, JSON serialization/deserialization, and Student class examples.
  
  **Files include:**  
  - `0-read_file.py`  
  - `1-write_file.py`  
  - `2-append_write.py`  
  - `3-to_json_string.py`  
  - `4-from_json_string.py`  
  - `5-save_to_json_file.py`  
  - `6-load_from_json_file.py`  
  - `7-add_item.py`  
  - `8-class_to_json.py`  
  - `9-student.py`  
  - `10-student.py`  
  - `11-student.py`  

- **python-serialization/**  
  Tasks related to basic serialization of Python dictionaries.  
  - `task_00_basic_serialization.py`  

## Requirements
